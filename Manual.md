# RP Renamer User Manual
### Introduction
This renamer is made for the Monumenta official resourcepack, as some conventions are required for it to work. For what the renamer renames and into what, please check out the `README.md`.
It will unify some common textures in terms of their file names, so other community projects involving the resourcepack can have an easier time grabbing the texture.
